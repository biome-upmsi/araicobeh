# Pre-cpce and post-cpce codes for ARAICoBeH System

## This serves as a repository for pre-processing and post-processing scripts used in ARAICoBeH System.
## The current versions uploaded are the codes we've been using for our own data 
 (hence they may be a bit messy)
 
 
## We are currently preparing rmarkdown files for both sets of codes to guide other users
### and other data sets that can be used for testing the codes.


## We'll upload them as soon as we finish cleaning them. 
### Thank you and cheers!
